  <h2>💖 What’s in a Name?</h2>

  <div class="accommodation-text">
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🐱 Our Cattery is named after our handsome, gentle, caring boy Clarence. We sadly lost him in June 2016 at the very grand age of 24 years old. I was privileged to have had Clarence with me since he was 9 weeks old - rescued from a farm where he was neglected and mistreated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>😼 As a kitten, he was extremely mischievous — climbing curtains, sitting on rooftops, fighting with my pigtails and even stealing a joint of beef from my next door neighbour’s kitchen worktop!!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>In his older years, he was a best friend to both of my children. They dressed him up, put make-up on him, talked to him, and most importantly, they loved him to pieces.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🐾 Clarence was so loving, so affectionate, and his love unconditional... we all miss him terribly but were honoured to have him in our lives.</p>

  <h2>About Me!</h2>

  <div class="accommodation-text">

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>👋 Hello, my name is Kerry AKA Auntie Kes. I created Clarence’s as I wanted to make a special, unique place for pussycats to experience a wonderful holiday. Somewhere they get to feel safe, have lots of fun, be mischievous, relax, have cuddles galore, be pampered and thoroughly loved. I understand that it can be initially unsettling for your baby to adjust to its new surroundings, equally unsettling for the owners to leave their much-loved family member for the first time. I wanted to provide a second home for our feline friends — whilst here, they are absolutely part of my family.</p>
      <img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/3565/buIswc.png" alt="Cat Holiday Image 1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: 1rem auto; border-radius: 10px;">
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🐾 I have had cats for as long as I can remember and would never be without one. I have been blessed to have Ginny, Tawney, Joecat, Clarence, Dennis, Carlito, Humphrey, Dotty and Ralph in my life. Only one remains — my big Teddy Bear, Ralphie. Although the others have all passed on, they are still loved and will never be forgotten.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🎓 I have a Level 3 qualification in Feline Care, Behaviour and Welfare and a current Feline First Aid Diploma.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>💖 At Clarence’s your cat will be treated as an individual. If they want handfeeding, no problem… want me to lay on the floor with them, I’m there… tummy tickles — my speciality. Whatever your pussycat needs to make their holiday a contented, memorable one.</p>

  <h2>🐾 Accommodation</h2>

  <div class="accommodation-text">
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🐱 Clarence’s Cattery was designed purely for the comfort, happiness and safety of
      each guest by myself, purchased from Pedigree Pens and built by my husband,
      David AKA Uncle Dave. The cattery is completely UPVC which is absolutely
      fantastic as a high level of cleanliness can be kept at all times. The roof is made
      from a heat reflective material which helps to keep it cool in the summer. It is located
      in my garden, very close to my home so even when I am not in there (which is hardly
      ever) I can see in and they can see me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🐞 There are six suites, all built to the highest standards to comply with DEFRA
      regulations to obtain my FIVE star rating. We have the Ladybug, Bumble, Frog,
      Butterfly, Fish and Bird suites and each can accommodate two pussycats from the
      same household. For families of more than two, the suites can be opened up with
      the suite next door. Each suite has a bedroom which is fitted with a thermostatically
      controlled heater for the colder days, it is also insulated so stays lovely and warm in
      the winter. There is an iron bed for those pussycats who like to lounge and a pod for
      those who like to curl up, all furnished with fluffy blankets of course. Large litter
      trays, so plenty of space to move around when doing their business. Each suite also
      has an additional room which has a tower with scratching posts and hidey hole, a
      small chair for fluffy bottoms and a selection of toys. For those more adventurous
      climbers we have very high shelves too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🦜 The front of the suite is pawsafe mesh which leads to a safety corridor and looks out
      onto my garden. There are strictly no communal areas, pussycats from different
      households are not allowed to mix to ensure everyone is safe, healthy and happy.
      The mesh in the top of the safety corridor allows a constant flow of fresh air for our
      guests to breathe in. The garden is full of plant pots which attract butterflies and
      Bee’s for the pussycats to watch. We even get a cheeky squirrel called Steve who
      makes many an appearance to keep them entertained and a Heron who loves to
      land with his big feet on the roof!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🎶 The tunes are also always playing in the corridor; Classic FM is a firm favourite
      rather than Auntie’s singing !</p>

  <h2>🐾 Prices</h2>

  <div class="accommodation-text">

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🐱 <strong>New Daily Rates (from 1st Jan 2026):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✨ <strong>£19</strong> per day for one pussycat</li>
        <li>✨ <strong>£26</strong> per day for two pussycats sharing one suite</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🧁 All prices include food, litter and treats. I provide Felix AGAIL, Sheba, Purina Gourmet and Whiskas wet. Royal Canin Sensible, Purina One and Iams dry.</p>
      <p>🍗 A selection of treats are always available too — Webbox Licky Lix, meat sticks, Dreamies, Felix Goody Bags and freeze-dried. I also always have tinned Tuna, Fresh Tuna and Chicken and my famous Tuna Surprise to entice our fussier guests.</p>
      <p>🍽️ If you would like your baby to stay on a particular diet though, you are of course welcome to bring their own food — just please ensure you provide enough for their entire stay.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>🧸 Prices also include me. Lots of playtime and as many snuggles as they would like. Time is taken to get to know each pussycat and their individual personality — what makes them happy, what makes them sad. They are unique and all need to be looked after in different ways.</p>
      <p>📸 I promise you that each one is thoroughly loved and becomes part of my family. I also provide photo/video updates on my Facebook page or directly by WhatsApp so you can see what we get up to!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>📋 <strong>Other Requirements:</strong></p>
      <p>
        🐾All cats MUST be fully vaccinated against FHV – Feline Herpesvirus - yearly<br>
       🐾 FCV – Feline Calicivirus - yearly<br>
       🐾 FPV – Feline Panleucopaenia Virus – every three years or I am afraid they cannot stay. If your cat misses a booster then will need a restart.<br>
       🐾 Restarts require two injections 3–4 weeks apart and both injections must be completely at least two weeks prior to arrival.<br><br>

        All cats MUST be up-to-date with their flea and worm treatment before coming into Clarence’s Cattery. Details need to be provided.<br><br>
